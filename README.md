### Introduction

[Magdalena J Koziol Lab](https://dnalaboratory.org/) is studying and aiming to discover further novel DNA and RNA modifications and investigate their role in the brain using mass spectrometry, MS-imaging (MSI) and nanopore sequencing, etc. 

The MSmodification package is developed to analyze the MSI data.

#### Quick start

1. **Installation and load the package**

```R
#MSmodification package can be installed from github using:
devtools::install_github("HouyuZhang/MSmodification")
#Load the installed package
library(MSmodification)
```

2. **MSI raw data pre-processing**

- Calculate the modification intensity based on the reference table, you can find reference tables [here](https://github.com/HouyuZhang/MSmodification/blob/master/CustomeScripts/MSmodification_referenceList.xlsx).

```R
CalculateModificationIntensity(MSFilePath = "Negative_raw/",
                               ModificationReferenceFile = "Modification_reference.csv")
```

- Merge each samples into a consensus table:

```R
MergeModificationIntensity(CSVPath = "./Negative", run_RunMetaboAnalystR = F)
```

- Normalize the intensity using three methods:

```R
#Normalization across each section
NormalizationIntensitySections(IntFileName = "Negative-merged.csv",
                       SampleIndex = c("loxP1","loxP2","loxP3","KO1","KO2","KO3"),
                       SectionIndex = c("-01","-02","-03"))
#Normalization across each slide
NormalizationIntensitySlides(IntFileName = "Negative-merged.csv",
                             SectionIndex = c("-01","-02","-03"))
#Normalization using the percentage
NormalizationIntensityPercentage(MergeModificationIntensityFile = "Negative-merged.csv",
                                 ModificationReferenceFile = "Modification_reference.csv")
```

3. Analyze modification dynamics based on selected brain regions and modification types

```R
PickBrainRegion(MergeModificationIntensityFile = "Negative-merged-NormalizedPercentage.csv",
                PickBrainRegionNames = "cerebellum",
                run_RunMetaboAnalystR = T,
                FeatureList = c("m6Am","ac4C","m22G","hm5CTP","m6dA","m5dC",
                                "ca5dC","m5dCTP","m6dATP","f5dCTP","m5CMP","m6AMP"))

BoxModification(MergeModificationIntensityFile = "Negative-merged-NormalizedPercentage.csv",
                SampleIndex = c("mettl3-loxP1-","mettl3-loxP2-","mettl3-loxP3-",
                                "mettl3-KO1-","mettl3-KO2-","mettl3-KO3-"))
```

#### How to generate the MSI rawdata?

- The whole mouse brain is dissected and frozen at -80 degree, then brain was sliced into 20Î¼m `sections` covering the `sides`

- Slides was subjected to the MSI machine for scanning with a full channel

- MSI results can be visualized by MassImager, brain regions of interest can be segmented to extract the m/z information

  ```R
  #There is a builtin function to generate excel with sheet to store MSI segmentation results
  GenrateExcelforMSdata(SamplesNames = c("loxP1","loxP2","loxP3","KO1","KO2","KO3"),
                        BrainRegionNames = c("cerebellum","pons&medulla","midbrain",
                                             "hippocampus","thalamus","hypothalamus","fornix",
                                             "caudate putamen","basal forebrain",
                                             "ventral striatum","anterior olfactory",
                                             "olfactory bulbs","cortex","corpus callosum"),
                        SectionNames = c("01","02","03"))
  ```
